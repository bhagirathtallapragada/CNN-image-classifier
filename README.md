# Building a classifier to classify images of cats and dogs using convolutional neural networks (a project to understand application of CNNs for image classification)

## Objective:

1. Build and train a CNN on training data of 8000 images of cats and dogs 
2. Predict labels for a test set of 2000 images of cats and dogs

## Method

Build a network of two 2D convolution layers with kernel size=3. Flatten and feed the output to a Neural network with one hidden layer.
